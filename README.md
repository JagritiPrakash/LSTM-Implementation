# LSTM-Implementation-Keras-TensorFlow
Time Series Analysis with LSTM. We will see how we can perform time series analysis with the help of a recurrent neural network. We will be predicting the future stock prices of the Apple Company (AAPL), based on its stock prices of the past 5 years.
For training our algorithm, we will be using the Apple stock prices from 1st January 2015 to 31 December 2019.
We take the details of january 2020 for the testing purpose
